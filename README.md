NestJS E-Commerce Microservices ProjectWelcome to the E-Commerce Microservices project! This is a robust, scalable backend system built with NestJS, demonstrating a modern microservice architecture combined with event-driven principles. The system is fully containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment.üèõÔ∏è Architecture OverviewThis project implements a microservice architecture where each service is an independent application with a single responsibility. The services communicate with each other over a private network using TCP for synchronous requests and Kafka for asynchronous, event-driven communication.The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all external clients, handling HTTP requests, authenticating users, and routing traffic to the appropriate internal service.High-Level Data Flow(This is a conceptual diagram. In our implementation, all internal communication happens via TCP or Kafka within the Docker network.)ServicesServiceResponsibilityTechnology StackCommunicationüì¶ api-gatewayThe single entry point.

Clone the Repositorygit clone <your-repository-url>
cd ecommerce-app
2. Configure Environment VariablesCreate a .env file in the root of the project by copying the example file.cp .env.example .env
The default values in the .env file are pre-configured to work with the docker-compose.yml setup. You should review and change the JWT_SECRET for any real deployment.3. Install All DependenciesA helper script is provided to install the dependencies for all 9 microservices and the shared library.On macOS or Linux (or Git Bash on Windows):# Make the script executable (only need to do this once)
chmod +x install-all.sh

# Run the script
./install-all.sh
On Windows (using PowerShell):# You may need to adjust your execution policy first:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

# Run the PowerShell script
./install-all.ps1
4. Run the ApplicationThe entire system is orchestrated with Docker Compose. You can start all services with a single command.Using Make (Recommended & Easiest):# Build and start all services in detached mode
make up

# To stop all services
make stop

# To stop and remove all volumes (clean slate)
make down

# To tail the logs of all services
make logs
Using Docker Compose directly:# Build and start all services in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d

# To stop all services
docker-compose stop

# To stop and remove all volumes
docker-compose down --volumes
The API Gateway will be available at http://localhost:3000.üõ†Ô∏è API UsageA Postman collection is included in the project root: E-Commerce-API.postman_collection.json.Import the Collection: Open Postman and import this file.Run in Order: The collection is designed to be run in order. Start with the "Authentication & Users" folder to register users and log in. The login requests have test scripts that automatically save the JWT to a collection variable.Automatic Authentication: Subsequent requests that require authentication are already configured to use the saved token from the variables.This allows you to easily test the entire workflow, from creating products to adding them to a cart and placing an order.üîÆ Future ImprovementsThis project serves as a strong foundation. For a production-grade system, the following steps would be next:Testing: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and e2e tests for each microservice.CI/CD: Create a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployments.Centralized Logging: Integrate a logging stack (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki) for better observability.Monitoring & Tracing: Add Prometheus for metrics and Jaeger/OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to monitor the health and performance of the services.**
